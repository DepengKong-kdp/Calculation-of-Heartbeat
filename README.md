# Implementation of the heartbeat calculation algorithm

This is a `Python` implementation of heartbeat calculation algorithm given the ECG measurement as input. It is used in the work `Stretchable grapheneâ€“hydrogel interfaces for wearable and implantable bioelectronics.`

This implementation can be run on operating systems including Windows, Linux, and MacOS, as long as they have been installed with the dependencies listed in the `requirements` document.
